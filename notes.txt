We need to be able to tell the actuator which position to go to, and with
which speed. We should also be able to give new instructions before the
previous ones were completed. Finally we should be able to wait until each
instruction is either completed, or aborted/superseded.

We can only have one task at a time, so it makes sense to have one state to
keep. We could have a completion/interruption callback attached to the state.
Then we could have an API that would lock that state, and call interruption
callback when we give it a new task. The timer function would strive to
execute the task and call completion callbacks.

How about we have a semaphore that's taken for moving the actuator and
returned when moving is done, or aborted?

MOVE LOCK?

What are we trying to do?

We want to make sure only one thread has control over the actuator, one "procedure".
The command takes control, does its job (moving the actuator,
calibrating/aiming, running a test, etc.), and then releases control.

We want to be able to cancel a command.
	- So, if we want the actuator module to go and do something for us by
	  itself, we need to be able to abort that long-running task. That
	  means we would need to have two-level abort: one level for the
	  actuator library, and one for the command.
	- However, even if we would e.g. try to control the actuator fully, in
	  the command itself, we would still need to have two-level abort: one
	  for the sleep intervals, when we're waiting for the next step, and
	  one for the command itself. So, perhaps, we could live with two
	  levels.
	- E.g. implement locking "actuator control", and provide a function to
	  break that lock, which would make all the functions trying to
	  continue executing with that lock, abort.
We want to be able to reset the robot completely.
	- a simple controller reset would be fine,
	as that would immediately bring "enable" down,
	and release control of the actuator

OK, how about we return a value when enabling the actuator, then use that value
when locking the actuator use, which would return another value.

Should another module be able to turn off the power without knowing the "power"?
Should we perhaps make the "power" value internal to the kp_act module?

What are we trying to do?

* To make it safe to use the actuator from separate threads on a multi-core
  system? Soo...
	* Should a thread be able to "turn on" the actuator if it's already
	  turned on by another thread? The same thread?
	* Should a thread be able to turn off the actuator if it's turned on
	  by another thread?
	* Should a thread be able to cancel a movement requested by another
	  thread?
	  	- We need this for aborting shell commands
	* Should we perhaps provide strongest guarantees for thread
	  separation, and let threads decide how much control they want to
	  share with other threads?
	* There's a difference between protecting threads and giving out
	  the users unique values to handle power ons and actuator movements.

* To make sure that absolute position values are not used across power-ons?

We have a single lock for the complete internal state.
We hold the lock while moving to prevent the power being turned off and
another move competing with our move.
We need to be able to abort a move.
	To be able to do that we need to verify that the correct power is
	supplied to the function. To access that we need to acquire a lock.

We need to figure out which pieces of internal state we need when, and how
consistent we need them.

Possible operations and exclusivity

TODO: Check that the actuator module is initialized in all its functions.
	- done
TODO: Consider adding a function checking if a position is valid for a power.

We need to keep all the state locked at first, when starting the movement, and
then unlock the termination flag, so that abortion can happen.

The abortion function needs to verify if the power is on, and if the movement
is running, and then abort.

Timer function:
	With locked state:
		If power is off
			Give movement semaphore
			Stop
		If abort is requested
			Reset abort flag
			Give movement semaphore
			Stop
		Move next step

Move function:
	With locked movement:
		Lock state
		Setup timer
		Unlock state
		Take movement semaphore

We need to prevent two move functions being called at once

OK, how do we organize running interactive shell commands?

Shell commands are assigned a kp_cmd_* function each.
The kp_cmd_* function reads and validates arguments, and invokes a library
function specifying which function to run for the actual command body, and
returns with status zero.

The library function sets a shell bypass function which interprets input
sequences, and schedules executing the specified function with another thread,
then returns.

The other thread runs the function, then removes the shell bypass function, to
give control back to the shell.

Can we use setjmp/longjmp to keep the body of actual command inside the
kp_cmd_* function?

So something like this would be nice:

kp_cmd_blah(shell, argc, argv)
{
	/* Parse and validate args */
	...
	/* Install shell bypass, return control to shell */
	YIELD_TO_SHELL;
	/* Run inside separate thread, outside shell */
	/* Return to the thread, which removes shell bypass */
	DONE;
}

Likely won't work, as that would be jumping from one thread's stack to another
thread's stack.

What if instead we had a single generic function save the arguments we're
passed, install the bypass function, schedule execution of the actual
command in another thread, and return to shell. Another thread calls the
function, and then removes the bypass function when it returns.

Or perhaps we can have a macro which installs the bypass function, stores the
current command function address and the arguments and schedules the function
execution in another thread, and returns to the shell. Then another thread
calls the same function but with e.g. a special command name, or maybe a
special shell pointer, and that makes the macro proceed with the function
execution instead. This seems like a good idea.

We can even put the argument validation in front of that macro, so it exits
early. It would be OK to validate and parse arguments again.

How do we implement command termination with Ctrl-C?
OK the input-reading function could scan the input for the Ctrl-C sequence,
and then somehow terminate the command. Maybe the command could pass a
termination callback to kp_shell_cmd_schedule, and that callback would abort
the movement with kp_act_abort(), and set a variable specifying that the
command was aborted?

TODO: Define the move timer inside the move function

0x1b 0x5b 0x43 - Right
0x1b 0x5b 0x44 - Left
0x0d - Enter
---

So, how should we record our pressure/report times? We can find out which step
triggers the report by calibrating/aiming. Then, before we request moving the
actuator the required number of steps to traverse the report point, in either
direction, we register the current time and the type of the movement
(press/release). After the movement is done, we wait for the report (timestamp
message from GPIO ISR on a message queue?).

OK, we can get a sequence of movement and trigger timestamp pairs in our
testing routine. Now what do we do with that?

We need tests for:
	Detection/report latency for both press and release events
		Take timestamp, move as fast as possible, take signal
		timestamp
		Repeat a bunch of times
		Calculate and report latency minimum, maximum, and averages
	Detection/report reliability/debouncing of both press and release
		Move the actuator with the specified speed
		Wait some time
		Check how many signals we get
		Repeat a bunch of times with varying speed and swing

Use Ctrl-C to abort exactly where you are, and Enter to stop nicely (e.g.
return to the start point of "swing").

Trying to add a shell input reading function

                    execute
                        exec_cmd
        }

Can we avoid the extra thread?

Nope, we gotta keep processing input

Actually, maybe we can have that special function poll for the RXRDY signal

Posted the failure on GitHub, waiting for advice/comments, continuing with the
hack for now.
---
So, we need to have an STM32 timer started by a rising edge of the "step"
signal, and a capture triggered by the signal we're interested in. If we want
to have more than one input signal, we need more than one timer, or at least
more than one channel. Gotta check that. OK, looks like we can have several
inputs and registers to register the timing. Great!

Now we gotta figure out which pins are available for which.
OK, the pins are listed on page 179 of RM. Default mapping:

CH1:	PA8
CH2:	PA9
CH3:	PA10
CH4:	PA11
ETR:	PA12

Next we'll need to figure out if more configuration is needed on those.
It's likely that it is needed, since there's an USART on PA8-9 by default.

TODO:
* Make sure USART doesn't interfere with the timer
	- switch the pins to "alternate function push-pull" somehow
* Make the timer start counting and overflow when movement starts

OK, PA11 and PA12 are out of the game, as they're used by USB for D- and D+.
So, we'll have to do with PA8, PA9, PA10. We could use PA10 for trigger, and
PA8 and PA9 for signaling.

Ah, it looks like only the first and the second input channels are connected
to the slave mode controller and can trigger the counter. Well, channel three
can do that too through a XOR gate with all other inputs, but we don't want to
mess with that. So it would be the other way around:

PA8:	Trigger
PA9:	Capture channel 1
PA10:	Capture channel 2

When starting the capture you can specify which channels/how to capture.
Then you can call a function requesting the result when/if it's ready.
---
TODO: Add support for awaiting overcapture for a bounce period
TODO: Retrieve the timer clock rate, like the PWM driver does
      (drivers/pwm/pwm_stm32.c)
---
We can simplify the actuator's interface if we keep the current power
module-side and don't force the caller remember and to provide it.

However, we would still need to expose and to use it for relative movements.
So, maybe we better get rid of the tracked power on altogether.

TODO: Rename kp_pos_* to kp_act_pos_*
	- done
TODO: Initialize GPIO pins outside module initializations
---
So, we need to support a bounce period for capture. It should be separate for
each channel, and should start immediately after the channel is captured.

We should wait for at least the specified period before concluding the
capture, but we can wait for longer, if we're waiting for other channels.

The maximum time we can wait for a channel capture should therefore be the
maximum timer period minus the bounce period.

It seems we need to have a "finish" timer that is started once the last
channel is captured. Should we adjust the auto-reload register then, to point
to the time we need to stop?

We can take the largest captured value across all channels, add the bounce
time to that, and write it to the ARR register.
---
We don't have to maintain the exact minimum bounce time and could take a
little longer. Therefore, we could take our time setting up the timer for
measuring the bounce period.

Once we got all the channels captured, we could stop the timer momentarily,
and shorten the ARR to the current time plus the bounce period, provided that
doesn't exceed the maximum capture time.

Wait, that doesn't let us finish the capture early, right after the timeout,
in case there was nothing captured.

What if we set ARR to the timeout initially, then when the first update
interrupt comes, we shorten the ARR to the bounce time, and on the second
update interrupt we finish.

Eh, maybe let's just keep it this way for now. Timeout of all channels is an
unlikely event, and the bounce time is usually short.

TODO: Use a signal generator to verify bouncing under timer resolution is
      captured.
TODO: Use a signal generator to verify bounce-time signals are
      considered timeouts.

---
What are we looking for?
The two steps: one immediately before the trigger and one at the trigger. We
might not be able to find them, because they will be too close to the trigger
point. Then we need to find the minimum range of steps where the trigger
happens reliably.

Perhaps we could do each transition a few times to make sure it's reliable,
and back off, it's not.

So, we could have three results for each transition: not triggering,
triggering, triggering unreliably.

We start without the assumption whether the current top-bottom range is
reliably triggering. We test it first, and then proceed.

function check_range(top, bottom, tries):
	for i in range(0, tries):
		move to top
		start capture
		move to bottom
		finish capture
		record result
	return triggered/not triggered/inconclusive

assert kp_act_pos_top < kp_act_pos_bottom
top = None
bottom = None
middle = None
next_top = kp_act_pos_top
next_bottom = kp_act_pos_bottom

forever:
	triggered = check_range(next_top, next_bottom, 3)
	if not triggered:
		# If we tried the top half
		if next_bottom == middle:
			# Try the bottom half
			next_top = middle
			next_bottom = bottom
			continue
		break
	top = next_top
	bottom = next_bottom
	if bottom - top <= 1:
		break
	middle = (top + bottom) / 2
	# Try the top half
	next_top = top
	next_bottom = middle

if not (top and bottom):
	error("No reliable trigger between top and bottom, not narrowed")

if top == kp_act_pos_top and bottom == kp_act_pos_bottom:
	info("The top and bottom positions are already as close as "
		"possible to the trigger point")
kp_act_pos_top = top
kp_act_pos_bottom = bottom

---
We need to handle the situation where we hit exactly the trigger point in one
of the steps and the trigger becomes unstable. We could rectify that by moving
further from the origin boundary. E.g. half way again to the opposite
boundary.
---
So, we need one final push to get actual use out of the device: measuring
timing. We need to make the "measure" command output timing of every pass
(optional), plus the summary (mandatory), for each channel: minimum time,
maximum time, and the average (which one, though? arithmetic mean for the
start? maybe mode as well, rounded to ms?).

TODO: Make k_poll_event_init() accept NULL object with K_POLL_TYPE_IGNORE

TODO: Figure out if we should check that the top position doesn't also hit the

So, something like "measure [<passes> [brief|verbose]]"

The question is whether we should do the waiting in the capture module or in
the kp_sample() function. In principle, capture doesn't really have to know
anything about moving. It doesn't even have to be invoked along with movement.

OTOH, the kp_sample() function knows exactly when the actuator, and should
expect the contact to bounce, so it is kp_sample() which should take care of
that.

Still OTOH, there's no support for polling for a timer/sleep, so we would have
to have some thread wait that bounce period and then give a semaphore in order
for the poll in kp_sample() to work out that the bounce period has ended.
Perhaps instead we could make the capture module do this for us with certain
inputs. For example, say that if we're invoking a capture with all channels
disabled, it will just wait for the bounce period. And if the code doesn't
want to do that, it should just not invoke the capture. Seems like a good
idea!

Ah, we have a problem: if we're not capturing any channels, we don't know how
long it takes to reach the trigger point, and so just waiting for a bounce
period doesn't work. It might be too short, because it only counts from the
moment of the first capture.

So perhaps we need to tell the users (ourselves :D) that you should have at
least one channel enabled both ways. And as a protection against this
situation we should perhaps make the capture module wait for the full timeout
plus bounce time when capturing with no channels enabled.
